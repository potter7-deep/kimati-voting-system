UNIVERSITY VOTING SYSTEM - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

=== REQUIREMENTS ===
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, or similar)
- Modern web browser

=== INSTALLATION STEPS ===

1. DATABASE SETUP
   a) Open phpMyAdmin or MySQL command line
   b) Run the SQL commands from database.sql to create the database and tables
   c) Default connection settings in config.php:
      - Host: localhost
      - User: root
      - Password: (empty)
      - Database: voting_system
      
   If your MySQL credentials are different, update config.php accordingly.

2. FILE PLACEMENT
   - Place all files in your web server's document root
   - For Apache: /var/www/html/ or htdocs
   - For local development: any accessible directory via localhost

3. DATABASE PERMISSIONS
   - Ensure the MySQL user has full permissions on the voting_system database
   - If needed, create a dedicated user in MySQL

4. PHP CONFIGURATION
   - Ensure PHP is installed and running
   - Sessions should be enabled (usually default)
   - Check php.ini settings if having issues:
     - session.save_path should be writable

5. START THE SYSTEM
   - For local testing: Open http://localhost/voting/index.php in your browser
   - For server deployment: Configure your web server accordingly

=== DEFAULT ADMIN SETUP ===

To create an admin account:
1. First, manually insert an admin user in the database:
   INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, registration_number, year, role) 
   VALUES ('Admin User', 'admin@university.edu', 'hashed_password', 'ADMIN001', 1, 'admin');

2. For the hashed_password, use PHP:
   php -r "echo password_hash('your_password', PASSWORD_BCRYPT);"

3. Or register normally and manually update the role:
   UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@university.edu';
